# **Knapsack Problem Solver**

## **Description**

This is a learning project that provides a Python script to solve the classic Knapsack Problem. The program uses a recursive approach to find the combination of items that maximizes the total score without exceeding a given weight capacity. The current example uses a predefined set of items and a specific capacity.

## **Disclaimer**

This is a learning project, created for educational purposes to practice Python programming.

## **Features**

* Solves the Knapsack Problem to find the optimal set of items.  
* Uses a recursive, brute-force approach to check all possible combinations.  
* Calculates and displays the best score and the items included in the optimal sack.

## **Installation**

This project does not require any special installation. Simply download the Knapsack.py file.

## **Dependencies**

This script is written in standard Python and has no external dependencies. It should run on any system with a Python 3 interpreter.

## **Usage**

To run the solver, navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal and execute the following command:

python Knapsack.py

The program will run automatically with the predefined items and capacity variables. The output will be the maximum score and the list of items that achieve that score. To test different scenarios, you can directly modify the capacity and items variables within the script.
